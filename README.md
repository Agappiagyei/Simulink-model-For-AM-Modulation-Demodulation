# Simulink-model-For-AM-Modulation-Demodulation

In transmission, it is required to modulate the message signal which has a lower frequency  with a carrier with higher 
frequency to be able to transmit across communication channel like free-space.
This is known as Modulation.
In analog modulation, a sinusoidal signal like sine-wave is used as the carrier. 
Three things could be modified; phase, frequency, and amplitude in order to use the sine-wave as the carrier. 
In Amplitude Modulation, we make changes to the amplitude of the signal to use it to transmit information. 

In this project, I modeled AM modulation and demodulation using Simulink - An add-on product to MATLAB, which provides an interactive,
graphical environment for modelling and simulating but not limited to different amplitude modulation schemes.

I also modeled an audion source to be transmitted through the AM model just as how it is in the AM-Studio. 
YOu could make change to the values of the blocks in the model to suit your needs.

Lets Have fun!
